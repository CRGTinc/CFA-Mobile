<h1><p align="center">Cases Help </p></h1>
<p>This section is divided into 3 sections: the left navigation menu, the top menu, and the form.</p>
<p>The left navigation menu is where you add and pick cases. To add a case, tap on the + button at the top of the left navigation menu. The case form to fill will appear to the right. To select an already existing case, tap on the case title in the left navigation menu. The top blue bar lets you know where you are in the case management.</p>
<p>Once in a case, you can add a form such as a device form or a photo form by taping the + button. Just as with the case, the form you select will appear to the right. To select an already existing form, tap on the form title in the left navigation menu. The top blue bar lets you know where you are in the case management.</p>
<p>On each of the form (Case, Device or other), the bottom toolbar lets you delete, export or save the form. When exporting a case, all children forms will also be exported. Deleting the case, will delete the children forms. </p>
